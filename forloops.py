# for loops in python
# u can iterate over a range, string, sequence etc.

# counter = 10
# for i in range(counter):
#     print('*')

# or print without a counter using range
# we can use range with a step to count in steps e.g range(1, 11, 2)
# for x in reversed(range(1,11)):
#     print(x)
# print("Happy New year!")    
    
# we can also iterate thru a string
myNumber = '0815649939'
